# CSE891 Mini Project 2: Classification with Neural Network
This is the second mini project in this class which accounts for 10\% fo your final grade. Similar to previous one you should do the project individually, without collaboration with any other students. The project requires implementing and evaluating a classification problem on Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set using multi-layer neural network.  You must implement your methods in Python using the provided template program.You are prohibited from using any Python libraries for Deep Learning (e.g., PyTorch  and TensorFlow) to do this project. You're expected to complete the project using numpy and the standard functions in Python. Please check with the instructor/TA first if you want to use other packages besides those provided by numpy. The project due date is December 6, 2019 (before midnight).
